Personal website

I am building this website to learn HTML/CSS and some Javascript.

The layout and contents of the website are original work, whereas the following elements have been taken from online resources:
- slick carousel: https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
- 3D flipbox: https://codepen.io/syedrafeeq/pen/yLYNqN

Thank you!
